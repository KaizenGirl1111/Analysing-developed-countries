# How do we help the most underprivileged countries?

We have extracted data on child mortality, imports, GDP etc., from 167 countries in the world. We have then applied unsupervised learning algorithms like DBSCAN, and Mini Batch K-means to cluster the countries with similar developmental curve and analysed each models performance on measures like Silhoutte Coefficient.
